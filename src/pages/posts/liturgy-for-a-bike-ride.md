## v2.1.2

We begin with gratitude for this ride.
For time to ponder amidst the sound of tires on road, chains going round,
For eyes to see the wonders and beauties of this world, big and small,
For the people in our lives who help make this time possible,
For the friendships and connections built through this medium,
For this route - roads, paths, and terrain - constructed and shaped over time,
For even the tiniest margin in our schedules,
For the bicycle, this beautiful and humble instrument,
And the gifts of bodies that move and breathe
For bones, muscles, organs, breath, life.

We understand, with application of thought and embodied intention,
Our time spent riding can transform into a humble act of something sacred,
A full-person act providing lasting significance,
Tapping into a power beyond us,
Guiding us in seeking after something greater than ourselves.

We want to see, deep down, the aspects of this act that are fleeting,
Worth little long-term value to ourselves and others,
The temptations of disastrous patterns of living, thinking, being,
That distract us from the infusion of flourishing this activity can bring.

We want to be strengthened through riding,
In more than just muscular and cardiovascular fitness,
But to grow in character more than performance: in mental fortitude, in patience, in kindness, in friendship,
In equity, grit, humility, and love.

We know riding has the ability to form us in unique ways,
Into someone who brings wholeness or someone who leaves behind a trail of brokenness,
Into a bright light illuminating the darkness or a darkened force using the people, things, and world around us,
Into someone more wonderful, more humble; or something nearing sub-human, overflowing with self-focus and pride.

With each revolution of the pedals,
We want to be formed into creatures more heavenly,
To be guided on a path to experiencing greater love,
To be moved to be more loving with others and our world,
To grow in love,
To see beauty more clearly,
To be grateful for this time,
And to be brought into more discoveries of this mysterious overlap of heaven and earth, here and now.

### v1.3

Lord, thank you for this day,
For bodies that move and breathe in you,
For time to ponder the wonders of your creation and beauties of this world,
And for the grace to be on our bikes.

Lord, we give you this avocation back to you
and ask you boldly to empower us, through your Spirit,
to seek after your kingdom,
and transform our rides into humble acts of worship.

We ask for the wisdom to see what’s fleeting,
and the ability to remain in you.
Highlight the ways this sport draws us to lesser things and idols, long and deeply held,
And infuse this ride with your life-giving presence.

Jesus, you died for us.
Let that fact drive us to seek connection with you,
as well as relationships diverse and genuine,
in this unique expression of spiritual formation.

Strengthen us to boldly come in your name,
to bring wholeness to the shattered areas of this world,
both to our lives and the lives of those that you’ve gifted to us to walk (and ride) alongside.
Grant us to be your light, illuminating the darkness.

Use this time to form us more and more into your images, Jesus.
May this ride be a path to experiencing your love for us and your love for the world.
Move us to love and connect with others,
And bring us to discover a small slice of the Garden, here and now.

### v1.2

Lord, thank you for this day,
For time to ponder the wonders of your creation and beauties of this world
For a body that moves and breathes in you
And for the grace to be on my bike.

Lord, I give you this avocation
and ask you boldly to empower me, through your Spirit,
to seek things eternal in my quest,
and the power to see what’s fleeting,
and remain in you.
Holy Spirit highlight the ways this sport may try to draw me to lesser things and deep idols, long held.

Jesus, you died for me.
Let that fact drive me to seek connection with you as well as diverse and genuine relationships in this unique personal expression of spiritual formation,
and to boldly come in your name to bring completeness, peace, and wholeness to the areas of this broken world, both mine and others, that, by your grace, you’ve allowed me to experience.

### v1.1

Lord, I give you this avocation
and ask you boldly to empower me, through your Spirit,
to seek things eternal in my quest,
and the power to see what’s fleeting
and remain in you
even as this sport may try to draw me to lesser things and deep idols, long held.

Jesus, you died for me.
Let that fact drive me to seek connection with you and connection with a community of believers in this unique personal expression of spiritual formation
and to boldly come in your name to bring completeness, peace, and wholeness to areas of the broken world, both mine and others.

### v1

Lord, I give you this avocation,
and ask you boldly to empower me, through your Spirit,
to seek things eternal in this quest,
to see what’s fleeting and remain in you
even as this endeavor may try to draw me to lesser things and deep idols, long held.

Jesus, you died for me.
Let that fact drive me to seek connection with you,
in this unique personal expression of spiritual formation.

Remind me that this pursuit is not about me,
but about the community of humans made in your image,
some believers and some not,
and drive me to see this hobby as a special way you’ve created us to connect.

Guide me to come in your name to bring completeness to my life and the little section of the world I have been given the grace to encounter.
