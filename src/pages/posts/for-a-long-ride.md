Lord, you are so good, so generous
To grace your creatures with a garden to delight within,
With a spirituality that is lived out in our bodies
With extended time, space, and ability to go for a long ride.

Keep us safe on this journey,
Hold us in the refuge of your strength,
Protect us from pitfalls
And bless this time as a gift of formation into your likeness.
