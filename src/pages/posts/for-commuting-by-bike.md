What a blessing!
To use this body I have been gifted to move,
To traverse A to B at a reflective pace,
To experience fresh air and an elevated state.

What a blessing!
To get to know this route,
To experience the roads, paths, neighborhoods, cities, countrysides;
To be a trail of light each day through this small piece of the world and the people along this path.

I ask for safe passage, kind conditions, attentive and courteous drivers,
And for this time riding to bring my heart into a place
Where I am ready to offer my best to my work,
Not as a sacrifice of myself to a career,
But as an expression of love for the people I work with,
For the job I get to do each day,
For the clients, customers, and people I have the honor of serving.
