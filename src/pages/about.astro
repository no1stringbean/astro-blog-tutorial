    Here are a few (boiler plate) facts about (not) me:
    <ul>
      <li>My name is {identity.firstName}.</li>
      <li>
        I live in {identity.country} and I work as a {identity.occupation}.
      </li>
      {
        identity.hobbies.length >= 2 && (
          <li>
            Two of my hobbies are: {identity.hobbies[0]} and{" "}
            {identity.hobbies[1]}
          </li>
        )
      }
    </ul>
    <p>My skills are:</p>
    <ul>
      {skills.map((skill) => <li class="skill">{skill}</li>)}
    </ul>
    {happy && <p>I am happy to be learning Astro!</p>}

    {finished && <p>I finished this tutorial!</p>}

    {
      goal === 3 ? (
        <p>My goal is to finish in 3 days.</p>
      ) : (
        <p>My goal is not 3 days.</p>
      )
    }
